This repository contains my own personal work and serves as part of my own work portfolio. Its sole purpose is to demonstrate my skill set to others. ANY OTHER USE OF THE MATERIALS WITHIN ARE HEREBY PROHIBITED. Please do not plagiarize my code in your coursework. Doing so is an academic honesty violation at most educational institutions.

Description of Assignments
==========================

Programming Assignment 1 (pa1 and pa1-prelab)
---------------------------------------------
The program uses vectors and linked-lists to represent a jar of marbles. The jar cannot contain duplicate marbles and many functions can be performed.

Programming Assignment 2 (pa2)
------------------------------
Demonstrates several different sorting algorithms and their running times.

Programming Assignment 3 (pa3)
------------------------------
Demonstrates linked list, linked queue, and linked stack data structures. Able to reverse the contents of a file using the "reverse" program.

Programming Assignment 4 (pa4)
------------------------------
Demonstrates the binary tree data structure.

Programming Assignment 5 (pa5)
------------------------------
Demonstrates the priority queue data structure using both a binary heap and a vector. Serves as the pre-lab for assignment 6.

Programming Assignment 6 (pa6)
------------------------------
Final project in course. Demonstrates the graph data structure. Able to compute the single shortest path between two nodes in a given graph by using Dijkstra's Algorithm.

Additional Information
======================
Each of these assignments contains a written report in both PDF and LyX format. These reports give detailed information on each assignment and contain all sources used to create the programs in this repository.
